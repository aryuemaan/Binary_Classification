# Binary Classification with Bank Dataset (Kaggle)

This repository contains a **binary classification project** using the [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/), aimed at predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic, behavioral, and campaign-related features.  

The project demonstrates an **end-to-end machine learning workflow**:  
- Data preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Performance comparison of multiple classifiers
